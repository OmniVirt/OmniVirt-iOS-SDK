# Tutorial - Let's embed your content into your app

VRKitExample project mainly consists of VRKit.framework and ViewController code.
The program is very simple and coded in very straightforward way.
This tutorial shows you how to make fullscreen cardboard app within minutes.

Inside ViewController, you will find View created under "Player" named with VRPlayer class.

Try making this VRPlayer stretching into fullscreen by adding Vertical constraint with zero value.

Replace your OmniVirt content ID and insert "player.cardboard = Mode.ON;" inside playerLoaded function.

# Alternatively, you can create the embed player without using Storyboard by using below codes.

   <pre>
   let _player = VRPlayer.create();
   _player.load(withContentID: 24); // Replace 24 with your Content ID
   _player.frame = self.view.frame;
   self.view.addSubview(_player);
   _player.layoutSubviews();
   </pre>
